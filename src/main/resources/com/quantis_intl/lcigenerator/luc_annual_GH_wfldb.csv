Comment
This dataset represents the interventions associated with the provision of 1 kg NPP0  by land that is already in use. Adapted from ecoinvent 3 process, with parametrized NPP value.Production volume: 21810000000000 kgIncluded activities start: Starts with the land already in use.Included activities end: This activity ends with the provision of arable land tenure, measured in unit kg carbon Potential Net Primary Production (NPP0) per square meterThe dataset includes all interventions associated with the provision of 1 kg NPP0 from land already in use.Energy values: Gross valuesGeography: Already used arable land Technology level: 4 OldStart date: 1990-01-01End date: 2013-12-31Is data valid for entire period: trueTime period: Publication of dataMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual

Comment
"This dataset covers the impacts associated to 1 ha of land use change (LUC), split between change from annual crop, perennial crop, primary forest, secondary forest and grassland according to the 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants ""WFLDB-adapted-Blonk 2014 direct-land-use-change-assessment-tool_2015-05-18a.xlsx"". This process is specific to the country and to the type of the crop (annual, perennial or paddy rice). The amount of this process to take into account as input to the crop inventory depends on the LUC allocated to the specific crop. This allocation is also calculated using the 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants, based on FAO data. This dataset includes land tenure processes in kg NPP0. It also includes C and N emissions due to soil degradation, when occuring, according to IPCC 2006. Peat soil degradation is included separately, based on Joosten (2010) and IPCC (2013) data."
