Electricity, high voltage, as produced in Canada (IEA 2009)Included processes: Included are the electricity production in Canada, the transmission network and direct emissions to air (ozone and N2O). Electricity losses are accounted for and assumed similar to European average (RER mix).Remark: This dataset describes the transmission of high voltage electricity.

Electricity, low voltage, as produced in Canada (IEA 2009)Included processes: Included are the electricity production in Canada, the transmission network and direct  SF6-emissions to air. Electricity losses during during low-voltage transmission and transformation from medium-voltage are accounted for (assumed similar to European average (RER mix)).Remark: This dataset describes the transformation from medium to low voltage as well as the transmission of electricity at low voltage.
