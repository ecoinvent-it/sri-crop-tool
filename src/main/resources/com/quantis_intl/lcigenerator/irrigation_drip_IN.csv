Comment
"Drip irrigation (micro-irrigation) in IndiaOpenloop drip irrigation system, without recirculation of drainage water, used for tomato production in Spain (Torrellas et al. 2012).Included plastic components: beds, pipes, drippers, micro tubes and stakes.Included steel elements: injectors and pumps.Electricity use based on ecoinvent process ""Irrigating/US"".Water input is not included.Source data per hectare, with water consumption = 4748 m3/ha, including 25 % watering surplus to avoid build-up of salts."
