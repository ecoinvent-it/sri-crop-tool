Comment
This dataset represents the interventions associated with the provision of 1 kg NPP0  by land that is already in use. Adapted from ecoinvent 3 process, arable land already in use, with parametrized NPP and VEG values.Production volume: 21810000000000 kgIncluded activities start: Starts with the land already in use.Included activities end: This activity ends with the provision of arable land tenure, measured in unit kg carbon Potential Net Primary Production (NPP0) per square meterThe dataset includes all interventions associated with the provision of 1 kg NPP0 from land already in use.Energy values: Gross valuesGeography: Already used arable land Technology level: 4 OldStart date: 1990-01-01End date: 2013-12-31Is data valid for entire period: trueTime period: Publication of dataMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual
