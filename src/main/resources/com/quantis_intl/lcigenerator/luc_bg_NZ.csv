Comment
This dataset represents the interventions associated with the clear-cutting of grassland for the provision of arable land tenure. Adapted from ecoinvent 3 process, with parametrized NPP and VEG values.Production volume: 20820000 kgIncluded activities start: From the natural state of grassland.Included activities end: This activity ends with the provision of arable land tenure, measured in unit kg carbon Potential Net Primary Production (NPP0) per square meter.The dataset includes the carbon stored in Above-Ground Biomas (AGB), Below-Ground Biomass (BGB)  and Dead Organic Matter (DOM) pools. It includes the fluxes from these carbon pools in terms of CO2. The loss/gain of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) usually associated with a land tranformation is accounted for in the downstream activity using the arable land tenure, given that it depends on the subsequent land use practice. Energy values: Gross valuesGeography: Colombian grasslandTechnology level: 2 ModernStart date: 1990-01-01End date: 2013-12-31Is data valid for entire period: trueTime period: Publication of dataMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual
