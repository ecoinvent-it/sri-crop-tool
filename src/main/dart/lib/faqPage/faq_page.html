<div class="faqQuestion">What is meant by a beta version?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">ALCIG is finalized and should work properly. It is however still in beta version as a full set of quality check has not been performed so far. ALCIG is therefore used at the own risk of the users and results should be carefully checked. </div>

<div class="faqQuestion">When is ALCIG going to be finalised?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">The first version of ALCIG should be available early September. The beta version will be available for free until then.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Will there be documentation available?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Yes, a full methodological report will be available together with the tool. In addition, a forum will be implemented for users to shared knowhow, comments and information. The forum will be available only for the users of the tool.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Will ALCIG be free of use?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">No, ALCIG will be accessible in exchange of a licence. The pricing will be communicated to people interested.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">What background data are used?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">The tool uses ecoinvent data.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Will other output format be available?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Currently, only Simapro format and ecoinvent background data are available. In case you would like to have other background data used or other output format available, feel free to contact us so that we can evaluate the feasibility and make sure to inform you when the tool will integrate them.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">If I have comments and suggestions, what should I do?</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">I don't manage to import the generated CSV file into Simapro. Displayed error: "Unknown CSV format version (7.0.0},,,,,,,,,,,)."</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">You may have opened the generated CSV file with Microsoft Excel. This software adds some unwanted characters that corrupt the generated file. Please redo the export from ALCIG and import it directly into Simapro, without opening it with an other software.</div>
