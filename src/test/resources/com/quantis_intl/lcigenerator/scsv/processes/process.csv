Collection method
Sampling procedure: Process data based on stoechiometric calculations of few literature sources. Energy demand based on approximation from large chemical plant. Process emissions based on estimations only.

Comment
"Translated name: Cumene, ab WerkIncluded processes: Raw materials and chemicals used for production, transport of materials to manufacturing plant, estimated emissions to air and water from production (incomplete), estimation of energy demand and infrastructure of the plant (approximation). Solid wastes omitted.Remark: The functional unit represent 1 kg of liquid cumene. Large uncertainty of the process data due to weak data on the production process and missing data on process emissions.CAS number: 000098-82-8; Formula: C9H12; Geography: Data used has no specific geographical origin (stoechiometry). Average europenan processes for raw materials, transport requirements and electricity mix used.Technology: Production by alkylation of benzene and propene with a yield of 95%. Inventory bases on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt.% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in a internal waste water treatment plant assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).Time period: date of published literatureVersion: 2.2Synonyms: (1-Methylethyl)benzene, 2-PhenylpropaneEnergy values: UndefinedProduction volume: unknownLocal category: ChemikalienLocal subcategory: OrganischSource file: 00389.XML"
